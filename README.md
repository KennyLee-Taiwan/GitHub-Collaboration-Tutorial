# GitHub-Collaboration-Tutorial
* [Git] A tutorial on how to collaborate on GitHub with other programmers.

* I designed the GitHub collaboration workflow for M.A.D. Crew ( An iOS App developement organization that I cofounded ). The tutorial was originally designed and written by me, and further modified based on the valuable feedbacks provided by M.A.D. Crew's members.
